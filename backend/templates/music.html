    <p>Music can make a good game an unforgettable one. Video game soundtracks have evolved tremendously over the last few decades, from
      simple loops in early video games to the full orchestral performances in many modern games. Video game music is often abbreviated to VGM,
      however, according to Jamie Sexton from the University of Edinburgh, "the first and perhaps most important observation one can make about comtemporary video-game music is that there is no longer any such thing as video-games music".
      In some ways, VGM has outgrown

      Legendary video game music compose Kirk Grant told Mashable “The images tell the story, but the music tells you how to feel”.

      In the Breath of the Wild, when Link reaches a placed called Hateno Village, the theme song that starts to play evokes a sense of actual exploration
      of the world outside the screen. In Street Fighter and Tekken, the music is upbeat and energetic, whereas in Resident Evil and Silent Hill music is played sparingly but hauntingly.
      There is an abundance of memorable music in video games, on this page we explore a handful of these.

    <p>In Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, music plays an integral role to both the story and gameplay. Link learns to play the ocarina which helps him in his quest. The player "plays" the ocarina by inputting
      button combinations, the right ones will play the songs that are necessary to progress the story in given situations. While Wind Waker has a very different artstyle from its two predecessors, the musical element is
    roughly the same, with the notable exception that Link does not play an ocarina but uses a baton to conduct music. In later installments musical instruments are limited to a minor role if any, but the quality of the soundtracks
  is of the highest order.  In Breath of the Wild, reflecting the postapocalyptic landscape, the music takes a different turn that is only slightly recognizable as Zelda music; not that we are complaining.
